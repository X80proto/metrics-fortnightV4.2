    <h1>GPU Metrics Support</h1>
    <p>Welcome to GPU Metrics Support. If you have any questions or want to provide feedback about how we can improve our website, please don't hesitate to contact us via our discord server. We are committed to providing the best possible experience for our users and appreciate your input. Thank you for choosing GPU Metrics as your source for reliable performance data. </p>

    <h3>Submitting Benchmark Data</h3>
    <p>If you wish to share your benchmarking results with us, please do not hesitate to contact us at ##########. To provide our readers with the most accurate results, please provide us with relevant information about the PC that was benchmarked, including its CPU, GPU, RAM speed, motherboard, storage drive, and any overclocked components. For optimal benchmarking results, we recommend running benchmarks on a fresh installation of Windows 10 or 11, and closing any unrequired background processes and applications. This will help minimise usage and bloatware, resulting in the most precise benchmarking data. </p>
